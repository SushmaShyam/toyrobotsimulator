Overview:-

This is a toy robot simulator. It simulates placement and navigation of a robot on a grid. 
This simulator will not allow placement or navigation the robot outside the grid. 
A robot can be navigated only after it is placed on the grid

The grid size in this example is 5x5.

The commands accepted by the simulator are:-

- PLACE X,Y,F
- MOVE
- LEFT
- RIGHT
- REPORT

In this example, the commands are read out of a text file provided to the simulator via the command prompt.
Each command in the text file is on a new line.
The 'REPORT' command prints the current position and direction of the robot on to the standard output.

Installation:-

You can git clone this repository onto your machine and 'bundle install' to have all the dependancies needed. 
There is only one dependancy we have as of now, and that is the rspec gem used for writing the tests.

Instructions for running the application:-

This application can be run from the command line using the following command

rake simulate[testdata/data.in]

The parameter inside the square brackets is a file that contains the commands that need to be handled by the simulator.

More about this toy robot simulator:-

The usage of the MVC design pattern in this software, seperating the routing of commands (Simulator) , the actual business logic (Robot) and 
the view (RobotView) allows for the below mentioned extensions.

This simulator can be extended to support more commands, by adding more methods to the robot. 
Since dynamic method invokation is used, the simulator as such need not be modified for additional command support 

While the report command today simply prints the current position and direction onto the console, it can be extended
to show a graphical representation of the simulation by extending the RobotView Class
